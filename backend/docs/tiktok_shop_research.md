# TikTok Shop Data Access Research

## Overview
TikTok Shop is TikTok's integrated e-commerce platform that allows creators to sell products directly through the app. It provides valuable trend data due to its young demographic and viral nature.

## Data Access Methods

### 1. Official TikTok APIs
- **TikTok for Business API**: Focused on ads, not shop data
- **TikTok Shop Seller API**: Requires seller account, only shows your own data
- **No Public Shop Trend API**: TikTok doesn't provide public access to trending product data

### 2. Web Scraping Approach (Recommended)
Since no public API exists, web scraping is the most viable option.

#### Available Data Points:
- **TikTok Shop Website** (www.tiktok.com/shop)
  - Trending products section
  - Category bestsellers
  - Flash deals (high velocity items)
  - Product view counts
  - Number of sold indicators

#### Technical Approach:
- Use Playwright for browser automation (handles JavaScript rendering)
- Implement rotating user agents
- Add delays between requests to avoid rate limiting
- Use residential proxies if needed

### 3. Alternative Data Sources
- **TikTok Creative Center**: Shows trending products in ads
- **Third-party tools**: Services like Kalodata or ShopPlus (paid)

## Implementation Strategy

### Data to Extract:
1. **Product Information**
   - Product name and description
   - Price and discount percentage
   - Category
   - Seller information

2. **Trend Indicators**
   - "X sold" indicators
   - Position in trending lists
   - Number of videos featuring product
   - View counts on product videos

3. **Viral Metrics**
   - Creator endorsements
   - Hashtag performance
   - Engagement rates

### Technical Considerations:
- **Rate Limiting**: TikTok has aggressive anti-bot measures
- **Dynamic Content**: Heavy JavaScript rendering
- **Geolocation**: Different products trend in different regions
- **Login Requirements**: Some data requires authentication

## Recommended Implementation

1. Start with Playwright for reliable scraping
2. Focus on public trending pages (no login required)
3. Implement robust error handling
4. Cache results aggressively (data doesn't change minute-by-minute)
5. Have fallback strategies for when scraping fails

## Legal Considerations
- Review TikTok's Terms of Service
- Implement respectful scraping (delays, limits)
- Don't scrape personal user data
- Focus only on public product information
