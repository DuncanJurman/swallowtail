# Swallowtail: Hierarchical Multi-Agent E-Commerce System
## Comprehensive Implementation Plan

### Executive Summary
Swallowtail is a two-phase autonomous e-commerce system that separates product discovery (Research Workshop) from product lifecycle management (Product Instances). The system uses a hierarchical multi-agent architecture with specialized AI agents handling different business aspects, from market research to fulfillment. Each product operates as an independent instance with customized agents, allowing for product-specific strategies while maintaining system-wide learning and efficiency.

## System Architecture Overview

### Core Components
1. **Master Orchestrator**: Central nervous system managing resources and coordination
2. **Research Workshop**: Continuous product discovery engine (Phase 1)
3. **Product Portfolio Manager**: Manages individual product instances (Phase 2)
4. **Product Instances**: Self-contained systems with customized agents per product
5. **Shared Services Layer**: Knowledge base, monitoring, resource pool, billing

### Technology Stack
We want to keep architecture costs as low as possible so keep this in mind. we want a solution that can be scalable but "pay as you go" as we will first be starting off as a single user with only a few products

- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI, Celery + Redis for task orchestration
- **Agents**: CrewAI/LangChain with custom agent framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (cache), Pinecone/Weaviate (vector store)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for live updates
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes for orchestration
- **Monitoring**: use basic logging
