 Instance Creation Wizard

  An instance in Swallowtail represents a business
  entity that users can manage. The wizard would
  guide users through setting up a new business
  with these steps:

  Step 1: Basic Information

  - Business Name: The name of the business/brand
  - Description: Brief description of what the
  business does
  - Type Selection:
    - Ecommerce (for online stores)
    - Social Media Management (for content/social
  presence)
    - Both (hybrid approach)

  Step 2: Platform Connections

  Based on the type selected:
  - For Ecommerce:
    - Shopify integration
    - WooCommerce integration
    - Other platforms
  - For Social Media:
    - Instagram connection
    - Twitter/X connection
    - Facebook connection
    - LinkedIn connection

  Step 3: Brand Configuration

  - Brand Voice: How the AI agents should
  communicate
  - Target Audience: Who the business serves
  - Key Products/Services: What the business offers
  - Brand Guidelines: Colors, tone, style
  preferences

  Step 4: Agent Selection

  - Choose which AI agents to activate:
    - Content Creator Agent
    - Customer Service Agent
    - Analytics Agent
    - Marketing Agent
    - etc.

  Step 5: Review & Create

  - Summary of all selections
  - Ability to go back and edit
  - Final "Create Instance" button

  The wizard would be located at /instances/new and
   would use:
  - Multi-step form navigation
  - Progress indicator
  - Form validation at each step
  - Ability to save draft and continue later
  - Integration with the backend API to create the
  instance

  This would replace the current "Create New
  Instance" button that's just a placeholder in the
   instances page.
